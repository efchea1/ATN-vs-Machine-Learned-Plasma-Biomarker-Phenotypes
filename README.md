# 📘 Overview
This repository contains the complete reproducible analysis pipeline for the manuscript:

ATN Classification and Machine‑Learned Plasma Biomarker Phenotypes Reveal Distinct Alzheimer’s Pathology in a Population‑Based Cohort  
Author: Emmanuel Fle Chea, MPH

The project compares:

- Theory‑driven ATN classification `(Aβ42/40, p‑tau181, NfL)`

- Data‑driven biomarker phenotypes derived from:

+ k‑means clustering

+ Gaussian mixture models (GMMs)

+ Variational Autoencoder (VAE) latent structure

PCA for linear comparison

Using **4,465 participants** from the **Health and Retirement Study (HRS) 2016 Venous Blood Study**, this pipeline evaluates concordance, stability, biological interpretability, and cognitive associations.

This repository is designed for transparency, reproducibility, and open scientific practice.
